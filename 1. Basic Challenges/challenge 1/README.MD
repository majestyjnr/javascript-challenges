Write a function in JavaScript that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array.

Example:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 12 (2 + 4 + 6)

Note:

The input array can have any number of elements (minimum 1).
The elements in the array can be positive or negative integers.
The output should be an integer.
