Write a function in JavaScript that takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeated character in the string.

Example:

Input: "hello"
Output: "h"

Input: "apple"
Output: "a"

Note:

The input string can have any length (minimum 1).
The input string can contain letters, numbers, and special characters.
The output should be a string with a single character.
